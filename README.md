Generate model that takes into acount the spatial correaltion 

this code solve the question 14M4 in the book "3 Statistical Rethinking A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and STAN (Richard McElreath)":
Use WAIC to compare the Gaussian process model of Oceanic tools to the models fit to the same data in Chapter 11. Pay special attention to the effective numbers of parameters, as estimated by WAIC. 
The model that conforms to the research hypothesis includes an interaction between log population and contact rate:
